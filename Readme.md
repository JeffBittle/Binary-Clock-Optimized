# Binary-Clock-Optimized
Not long after completing the Binary Clock project, I learned several graphics techniques to utilize the HTML5 Canvas more effectively and had some ideas myself about how I could reorganize the way I was handling the time data in order to minimize state changes.

So I wrote this more optimized version of the Binary Clock.  It also includes the use of powers of 2 sized canvas buffers to better utilize the memory of graphics cards providing the hardware acceleration.
